            'The Mercator is a map projector developed by the Flemish cartographer Gerard Mercator in 1569. It has become one of the most famous and widely used cartographic projections, especially for navigation.',
            'The Mercator projection preserves angles, which makes it useful for navigation, but it distorts the size of objects, especially near the poles, where they look much larger than they actually are. This projection allows you to draw straight lines, which makes it easier to determine the course. Despite its shortcomings, Mercator remains popular in modern maps and applications.'
